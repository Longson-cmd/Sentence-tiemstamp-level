Hello everybody! This is Jack Askew
from to fluency.com

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:10.290
and in this video we're going to talk
about English language levels, and I have

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.290
a question for you. So keep watching...

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.660
Before I ask you the question of what
English level you have,

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.210
I'm going to explain how you can
evaluate your own level using the Common

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.430
European Framework of Reference for
languages, and this splits English

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.830
learners into six different levels:

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.930
A1,  A2,  B1,  B2,  C1, C2

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.110
So let's have a look at all these
different levels so you can evaluate

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:56.860
your own English level currently. So the first one is beginner A1, and this is

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.629
where you can interact in a simple way
provided the other person talks slowly

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:04.780
and clearly and is prepared to help.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.010
This is where you can introduce yourself and others. You can ask and answer questions

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.939
about personal details, such as where you live,

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:19.630
people you know, and things you have. So that's A1. A2 is elementary and this is

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.700
where you can understand sentences and frequently used expressions, for example,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.020
very basic personal and family
information, shopping, local geography,

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.740
employment, etc. And you can communicate in simple and routine tasks on familiar

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.880
topics. B1 is interediate, and this is
where you can deal with most situations

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.280
likely to arise while traveling in an
area where the language is spoken.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:55.300
You can also describe experiences and events, dreams, hopes, and ambitions, and

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:02.740
briefly give reasons and explanations
for opinions and plans. Now moving on to

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.159
upper intermediate now, and this is a
level B2

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:12.340
this is where you can interact with a
degree of fluency and spontaneity that

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.230
makes regular interaction with native
speakers quite possible without

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.080
difficulty for either party.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:28.330
So that's a B2 level: upper intermediate. Now, C1 is advanced and, this is

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.050
where you can express ideas fluently,

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:36.750
spontaneously without much obvious
searching for expressions. You can use

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.700
language flexibly and effectively for
social, academic, and professional

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.260
purposes.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.850
So that's a C1 level. And then
finally, we have proficient, and this is C2

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:52.530
Now, look at this first one: Can
understand with ease

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.220
virtually everything heard or read. Can express him or herself spontaneously

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.260
very fluently and precisely,
differentiating finer shades of

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.980
meaning even in the most complex
situations.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:15.540
So those are the six levels according to the European Framework for Languages, so

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.370
now it's time for the question and what I want to know is this: what English level

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.720
do you currently have? What English level do you currently have?

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.450
Leave your comments below this video, and also tell me if you are happy with this

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.620
current level.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.620
Thanks for watching and see you next
time!
