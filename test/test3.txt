Hello this is Jack from tofluency.com and in this video
I'm going to talk about a process vs
an event and why this is relevant
to learning English. So, keep watching!
Think of a famous football player, for example
Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo
When we think about these football players, it's very easy to see their skills
And how they have benefited
from the skills, like the beautiful wives
the big cars, all the money, and the fame
but what we don't see is how they got there
we don't see what they did and what they continue to do
on a daily basis to have that really
high-level of skill. This is the same
for English learning too - when you see somebody
who is a non-native speaker speak fluently
understand what they hear and have lots of confidence when they speak
that's what we see, but again we don't see
what they did and what they continue to do
on a daily basis to have that high-level
this is important because having a high level of English
doesn't just happen overnight - it is not
just an event - instead it is the result
of a process; the result of doing the right things
on a daily basis - and when you focus
on this process and make the changes you need to make
to create the environment and habits of doing the right things
this is when you will start making real progress
that is why I say it's all about the journey - it's all about the journey
to fluency and having as much fun as possible
during this journey. So, make the changes you need to make
to reach a high level; get into the routine of learning English
and get into the habit of using English. If you have
any questions about this, leave them below the video
and also leave me a comment telling me
how you going to get into the habit of using English
every day. Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time!
