  "text": " Hello, this is Jack from tofluency.com and in this video I'm going to talk about a process versus an event and why this is relevant to learning English. So keep watching. Think of a famous football player. For example, Lino Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. When we think about these football players, it's very easy to see their skills and how they have benefited from these skills like the beautiful wives, the big cars, all the money and the fame. But what we don't see is how they got there. We don't see what they did and what they continue to do on a daily basis to have that really high level of skill. This is the same for English learning too. When you see somebody who is a non-native speaker speak fluently, understand what they hear and have lots of confidence when they speak. That's what we see. But again, we don't see what they did and what they continue to do on a daily basis to have that high level. This is important because having a high level of English doesn't just happen overnight. It is not just an event. Instead, it is the result of a process, the result of doing the right things on a daily basis. And when you focus on this process and make the changes you need to make to create the environment and the habits of doing the right things, this is when you will start making real progress. That is why I say it's all about the journey. It's all about the journey to fluency and having as much fun as possible during this journey. So make the changes you need to make to reach a high level. Get into the routine of learning English and get into the habit of using English. If you have any questions about this, leave them below the video. And also, leave me a comment telling me how you are going to get into the habit of using English every day. Thanks for watching and I'll see you next time.",
